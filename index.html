<p class="p1">"Knowing others is intelligence, knowing yourself is true wisdom."<br>- Lao Tzu</p>
<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, my name is Yashad Ramesh Margaj! I live in Badlapur, which is an amazing and exhilarating suburb of Mumbai. Presently, I'm a senior pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai, Mumbai. Previously, I had completed a High School Diploma in Computer Engineering from G. V. Acharya Polytechnic, Shelu. I had a memorable time of my life (Class I to Class X) at Fatima High School, Badlapur. The consistent propensity to think unusually, passion for learning new things and industrious nature with strong perseverance has helped me to gain worthwhile hands-on experience through some challenging opportunities. Currently, I'm working as a Machine Learning Intern at Foxmula and an Open Source Developer at Freeware Lovers GmbH. I had successfully worked as a Technology Intern at Bright Network, a Web Developer Intern at CoolAge and a Social Media Marketing Intern at IIT Bombay. Along with this diverse set of technical experiences, I've demonstrated proficiency in leadership and management. I've worked on a wide range of projects (Machine Learning, Android, Web, Java, C++, C, Chrome Extension, Google Assistant projects) making use of various technologies. The major aim of my life is to bring about a revolutionary change in the world by eliminating global climatic, health and social issues through constructive use of technology. Thank you :)</p>
