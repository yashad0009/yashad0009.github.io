<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, my name is Yashad Margaj! I'm from Badlapur, an amazing suburb near Mumbai. Recently, I've completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Major: Computer Engineering) at University of Mumbai, Mumbai. Since graduating from our school, I had worked on a number of projects that made use of various technologies. The tendency to think strikingly, passion for learning new things, and industrious nature with strong perseverance has extremely helped me to gain worthwhile experience through some challenging opportunities. I had successfully worked as a Web Development Intern at CoolAge, a Machine Learning Intern at Foxmula, a Technology Intern at Bright Network, and a Marketing Intern at IIT Bombay. I've demonstrated proficiency in leadership and management by working as a Microsoft Student Partner, a Techfest Campus Ambassador, and an Internshala Student Partner. Now, I'm looking for a full time opportunity where I can give my fullest, learn something new, and contribute my 200% towards the expansion and eminence of an organization :)</p>
