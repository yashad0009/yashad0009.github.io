<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, my name is Yashad Margaj. I'm from Badlapur, an amazing suburb near Mumbai. Recently, I've completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Major: Computer Engineering) at University of Mumbai. The tendency to think strikingly, passion for learning new things, and industrious nature with strong perseverance has extremely helped me to gain worthwhile experience through some challenging opportunities. I've around 6 months of hands-on experience in Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Also, I've demonstrated proficiency in leadership and management by working as a Microsoft Student Partner, a Techfest Campus Ambassador, and an Internshala Student Partner. Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer at Taskmonk.</p>
