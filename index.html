<p class="p1">"Knowing others is intelligence, knowing yourself is true wisdom."<br>- Lao Tzu</p>
<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, my name is Yashad Ramesh Margaj! I live in Badlapur, which is an amazing and exhilarating suburb of Mumbai. Presently, I am a Final Year Undergraduate pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai, Mumbai. Previously, I had completed a technical diploma coursework in computer engineering from the G. V. Acharya Polytechnic, Shelu. I had spent a memorable time of my life (Class I to Class X) at the Fatima High School, Badlapur. The colossal passion for learning new things, ability to work hard with strong perseverance and consistent propensity to think out-of-the-box has helped me to gain worthwhile industrial exposure through some challenging opportunities. Currently, I am working as an Open Source Developer at Freeware Lovers GmbH and a Machine Learning Intern at Foxmula. I have successfully worked as a Software Developer Intern at CoolAge, a Technology Intern at Bright Network, and a Social Media Marketing Intern at IIT Bombay. Along with this strong set of technical experience, I have demonstrated great enthusiasm in leading and building various communities at our institution. Also, I have worked on a wide range of projects (including but not limited to Machine Learning, Android, Web, Chrome Extension, Google Assistant and some native C, C++, Java projects) making use of various technologies. The major aim of my life is to bring about a revolutionary change in the world by eliminating global climatic, health and social issues through constructive use of technology. Thank you :)</p>
