<p class="p2">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello, my name is Yashad Margaj! I live in Badlapur, an amazing and exhilarating suburb of Mumbai. Presently, I'm a senior pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai, Mumbai. Previously, I had completed a High School Diploma in Computer Engineering from G. V. Acharya Polytechnic, Shelu. I had a memorable time of my life (Class I to Class X) at Fatima High School, Badlapur. The tendency to think strikingly, passion for learning new things, and industrious nature with strong perseverance has helped me to gain worthwhile hands-on experience through some challenging opportunities. I had successfully worked as a Technology Intern at Bright Network, a Web Developer Intern at CoolAge, a Social Media Marketing Intern at IIT Bombay, and a Machine Learning Intern at Foxmula. Along with this diverse set of technical experiences, I've demonstrated proficiency in leadership and management. I've worked on a wide range of projects (Machine Learning, Android, Web, Java, C++, C, Google Chrome Extension) making use of various technologies. The major aim of my life is to bring about a revolutionary change in the world, positively impacting billions of people, by eliminating all climatic, health, and social issues through constructive use of technology. Thank you :)</p>
